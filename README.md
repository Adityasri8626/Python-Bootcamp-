Python Programming Live Bootcamp
The Python 2 Days Bootcamp, featuring Adhiraj as the mentor, is an intensive course designed to immerse participants in the world of Python programming.

Python Bootcamp Day 1 Assignment
Question:

Imagine a fun game where you're challenged to guess a secret number. The computer selects a number between 1 and 100, and your task is to figure it out. With each guess, you'll receive hints to guide you.

What Youâ€™ll Build:

The Secret Number:
The game begins with the computer randomly selecting a number between 1 and 100. This is the secret number you'll be trying to guess.

Making Guesses:
You'll be prompted to guess a number between 1 and 100. If your input is outside that range or not a number, the game will remind you to try again.

Hints and Feedback:
If your guess is too low: "Too low! Try again."
If your guess is too high: "Too high! Try again."
If you guess correctly, you'll receive a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts.

Keep Guessing:
The game continues until you guess the correct number, so take your time and think carefully.

Ending the Game:
Once you've guessed the number, the game will end and let you know how many attempts it took.

Fun Extras:
To make it even better, handle any mix-ups in input (like letters instead of numbers) gracefully so you can focus on having fun.


Day 2 Assignment: Personal Expense Tracker

1. Add Expenses with categories.
2. View All Expenses and calculate your total spending.
3. Save Expenses to a text file for record-keeping.

Submission Instructions:

1. Ensure that your code is clean and well-commented.
2. Upload your project to a public GitHub repository.
3. Submit your GitHub repository link in the assignment submission section on CipherSchools.

Happy coding! ðŸ˜Ž
